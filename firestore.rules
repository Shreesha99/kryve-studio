/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset is designed for a public-facing content website.
 * The primary security goal is to make all content (blog posts, projects, services)
 * publicly readable by any visitor, while completely restricting all write
 * operations (create, update, delete) by default. This creates a secure, read-only
 * state for website visitors.
 *
 * Data Structure: The Firestore database uses a flat, non-hierarchical structure.
 * There are three top-level collections: /blog_posts, /projects, and /services.
 * There is no user-specific data or nesting, which simplifies the rules significantly.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All collections are configured to allow `get` and `list`
 *   operations for everyone, including unauthenticated (anonymous) users.
 *   This is essential for the website to display its content.
 * - Write Lockdown: All write operations (`create`, `update`, `delete`) are
 *   explicitly denied (`if false;`). This provides a highly secure default posture.
 *   It is expected that an admin role or a trusted server-side process will be
 *   granted write access in the future, and these rules must be updated accordingly.
 *   This approach prevents any unauthorized data modification.
 * - No Ownership Model: As there are no user accounts creating content through the
 *   app, there is no concept of document ownership. The data is treated as globally
 *   managed content.
